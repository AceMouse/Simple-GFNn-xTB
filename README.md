# Simple GFNn-xTB
An educational implementation of the GFNn-xTB algorithms for computational chemistry

## Goals for the project
- Clear literature references to every calculation
- Implementations should look like the referenced material
- A simple structure

## Explicite non-goals
- Optimizations that are not explicit in the literature
- A fast implementation
- Clean code / extensible code
